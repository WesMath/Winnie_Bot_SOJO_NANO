Winnie is a Discord bot for authors.  Winnie allows her users to track goals, challenge each other to word wars and sprints, and get prompts to assist with their writing.

## Adding Winnie to your Discord server

If you want to run Winnie on your server, you can either invite the public Winnie_Bot account or set up your own Discord bot with Winnie's code.
